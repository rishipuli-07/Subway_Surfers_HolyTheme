# Subway Surfers Inspired Game

A Unity endless runner game inspired by Subway Surfers. The player runs forward, avoids obstacles, collects items, and tries to survive as long as possible while moving through a 3D environment.

## Project Overview

This project is a 3D endless runner game created in Unity. It focuses on player movement, lane switching, jumping, obstacles, score systems, animations, audio, and game scene management.

The project was built as a game development practice project to demonstrate how endless runner mechanics work in Unity.

## Features

- Player forward movement
- Lane switching
- Jumping and movement mechanics
- Obstacles and collision detection
- Score or progress system
- 3D environment and map assets
- Character animations
- Audio and sound effects
- UI elements
- Prefabs for reusable game objects

## Technologies Used

- Unity
- C#
- Unity Input System
- TextMeshPro
- ShaderLab
- HLSL
- 3D models and FBX assets
- Unity animation system

## Gameplay

The player moves forward automatically through the level. The goal is to avoid obstacles and continue running for as long as possible. The game may include collectibles, score tracking, and increasing difficulty depending on the scene setup.

Typical endless runner mechanics include:

- Move left and right between lanes
- Jump over obstacles
- Avoid collisions
- Collect coins or items
- Try to get the highest score

## How to Run the Project

```

8. Press **Play** in Unity.

## Controls

The exact controls depend on the input setup, but a typical setup is:

| Action | Keyboard Control |
|---|---|
| Move Left | A or Left Arrow |
| Move Right | D or Right Arrow |
| Jump | Space |
| Pause/Menu | Esc |

If the project uses mobile input, replace this section with:
